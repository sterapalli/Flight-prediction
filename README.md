**Business case: Prediction of Airline Prices**
---------------
##### Understanding the Problem Statement in this Buisness Case
- Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. Airlines are using sophisticated quasi-academic tactics which they call "revenue management" or "yield management". The cheapest available ticket on a given flight gets more and less expensive over time. Conventional characteristics such as distance, while still important, are no longer the only determinants of pricing structure. Economic, marketing, and sociological factors have all played a growing influence in determining flight pricing. This usually happens as an attempt to maximize revenue based on :-

  -  Time of purchase patterns (making sure last-minute purchases are expensive)

  -  Keeping the flight as full as they want it (raising prices on a flight which is filling up in order to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive purchases)

##### Market Research
- According to a report, Indiaâ€™s civil aviation industry is on a high-growth trajectory. India aims to become largest aviation market by 2030. Indian domestic air traffic is expected to cross 100 million passengers by FY2017, compared to 81 million passengers in 2015, as per Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA).

- According to Google Trends, the search term - "Cheap Air Tickets" is most searched in India. Moreover, as the middle-class of India is exposed to air travel, consumers hunting for cheap prices increases.
